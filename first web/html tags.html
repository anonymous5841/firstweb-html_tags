<pre style="border: 4px solid rgb(255, 34, 0);">pre tag is used to give desired amount of gaps in your text and

    won't omit the gaps by default when output is shown on the screen as it does in other tags</pre>

<p style="border: 3px solid purple;">p tags are used to write paragraph in a website and are not like h tags we can also use  "lorem" is not a tag but is used to add random text to in your tags is used only as a tool </p>
<p>we can move our line to the next line by using <br> br tags they don't contain an ending tag there work is just like \n works in writing a code in code block i.e. move to the next line </p>

<pre style="border: 3px solid red;">multiple tags can't be used within one another for now the exception is br tag
there are block tags/elements that occupied the full width area from right to left on the whole screen,
inline tags only covers the width or area the text or image is covering and allows you to write things on other side too.
img tag is used to introduce image in your website. image take has two properties i.e. a source(that tells where the image is)
and a path(tells where a specific thing is kept).
we can add image to the website by using two method 1# Absolute path: it is used to tell the location of the image in your computer i.e. telling 
exactly where the image is kept location of the file in your drive. # absolute path SHOULDN'T be used while attaching the image #
2 # Relative path : this is given by adding the image within the folder that you are using to write a website in my case FIRST WEBSITE folder 
along with the index.html file.
add the image name in src that you have given to the image it is convinient to assign the picture a name and add the name in src
if the picture type is not written with it add the picture type that you have.
src full form is sorce
alt is used to tell the user that there is an image here i this portion hence we write image not found
in case if the users net is slow or there is anyother issue it is to just let the user know that this space is occupied by something
vh and vw is better to use than px and %
% is used in accordance with the screen i.e. if you write 100% in width and height both it will extend the picture in such a way that it will cover whole screen 
without leaving any space.
px that pixels adjust picture according to the pixels on the screen but it can cause picture to shrink and expand according to its own desired
as in a 1000 pixelated it will use its 100 pixels of it 
vh and vw are better to use as it adjusts the picture according to ones display screen.
</pre>

<img src="scenery.png" alt="Image not found" width="500vw" height="500vh" style="border: 5px solid black;">

<ul style="border: 3px solid navy;">ul stands for unorder list i.e. it gives text with bullets 
    <li style="border: 2px solid skyblue;">here</li>
    <li style="border: 2px solid skyblue;">are</li>
    <li style="border: 2px solid skyblue;">the </li>
    <li style="border: 2px solid skyblue;">bullets</li>
</ul>

<ol style="border: 3px solid green;">ol stands for order list i.e it gives numbers instead of bullets
<li style="border: 2px solid greenyellow;">here</li>
<li style="border: 2px solid greenyellow;">is</li>
<li style="border: 2px solid greenyellow;">the </li>
<li style="border: 2px solid greenyellow;">numbering</li>
</ol>

/*li tags defines a list item and is used with parent ol or ul*/

<table style="border: 4px solid darkviolet;">
    <tr style="border: 3px solid rgb(16, 123, 69);">
   <th style="border: 2px solid orange ;">th stands for </th>
   <th style="border: 2px solid orange;">table head </th>
   <th style="border: 2px solid orange;"></th>

    </tr>
   <tr style="border: 3px solid rgb(16, 123, 69);">

   <td style="border: 2px solid orange;">td stands for </td>
   <td style="border: 2px solid orange;">table data </td>
   <td style="border: 2px solid orange;"></td>
   </tr style="border: 3px solid ;">
</table style="border: 4px solid ;">

<pre>  table tag is used to form table in a website. it futher contains th tags it stand for TABLE HEAD,
  tr i.e. TABLE ROW and td i.e. TABLE DATA.
these table tag collection is used to make tables. th containing info and td containing info that is opposite to the info of th 
where tr defines that these are rows the / in the ending tag represent that the this tag is closing
we can identify if a tag is inline or blocked tag by the borders we have given to each tag. if they cover only the text written they will be inline 
and if they cover whole area on the right side than it's an inline tag.
 hence the tags we have used above are all border line tags except of the image tag and the table, th,td,tr tags
 there is a rule that if a parent is blocked than it's children is also blocked.

 NOTE:
 we have given borders above in the tags but it is not the preferred way to do we do styling in html by linking 
 a css file which is in the next file. here borders are given just to understand border and inline tags at initial stage.
 html is used simply for writting information.
